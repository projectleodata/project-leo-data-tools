# Project LEO Data Tools

Source code behind some of Project LEO's data tools that will be launched on Heroku for partner access and analysis as web-based applications. This repository is currently under development and will be built on in the coming months. (**No idea who I am writing this for! lol**)


## About These Tools

These data tools are meant for partner use with in Project LEO but have been designed with open-access functionality in mind post-LEO, thus affording fast-followers and other interested stakeholders the opportunity to access energy and data tools that will address shared issues in local energy markets and systems.
